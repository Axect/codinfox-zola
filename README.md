# Codinfox-Zola

This is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.com) theme inspired to [Codinfox-Lanyon](https://codinfox.github.com/), a Lanyon based theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). See a live demo [here](http://svavs.github.io).

Lanyon is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer.

This theme supports:

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color (changing in `_config.scss`)
2. Changable sidebar locations (reverse it by changing the boolean value in `_config.scss`)
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. Support for multilingual sites
5. Numerous improvements over original Lanyon
6. Improvements over original Codinfox-Lanyon

All the configuration variables and their meaning are inside:

- `config.toml` (for the zola config variables and some extra variables required by this theme),
- `author.toml` (for the personal informations to be displayed about the author of the site),
- `nav.toml` (for the navigation menu structure available in the site's sidebar)

for the site variables, and

- `_config.scss`

for the css style. The options are fairly straightforward and described in comments.
