# Codinfox-Zola

This is a Zola theme based on [Codinfox-Lanyon](https://codinfox.github.com/). See a live demo [here](http://svavs.github.io).

**If you like this project, PLEASE give it a star.**

Lanyon is a [Zola](http://getzola.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer.

All the configurations are inside either `config.toml`, `author.toml`, `nav.toml` for the site variables, or `config.scss` for the css style. The options are fairly straightforward.

The theme supports:

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color (changing in _config.scss)
2. Changable sidebar locations (reverse it changing the boolean in _config.scss)
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. and numerous improvements over original Lanyon
