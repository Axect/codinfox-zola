  Hey there! This page is included as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!
</p>


This is a [Zola](https://www.getzola.com) theme inspired to [Codinfox-Lanyon](https://codinfox.github.com/), a Lanyon based theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). See a live demo [here](http://svavs.github.io).

This theme places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer.

* Built for [Zola](https://www.getzola.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org)

This theme supports:

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color (changing in `_config.scss`)
2. Changable sidebar locations (reverse it by changing the boolean value in `_config.scss`)
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. Support for multilingual sites
4. and numerous improvements over original Lanyon and Codinfox-Lanyon

All the configuration variables and their meaning are inside:

- `config.toml` (for the zola config variables and some extra variables required by this theme),
- `author.toml` (for the personal informations to be displayed about the author of the site),
- `nav.toml` (for the navigation menu structure available in the site's sidebar)
- `_config.scss` (for the definition of some css customizations)

The options are fairly straightforward and described in comments.
